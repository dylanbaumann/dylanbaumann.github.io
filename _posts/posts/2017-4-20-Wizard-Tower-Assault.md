Our heroes find themselves at the base of the wizard Graymane's tower and an ominious, rhythmic ramming noise is coming from upstairs. 

### 1st Floor: Ransacked Library

They peeked into the doorway entering the Wizard’s tower. Inside they saw a ransacked library. There was bookcases  overturned, drawers pulled out of cabinets, chests have been flung open, etc. At the back of the room was a trap door, leading the basement which had been left ajar. To the right side of the room was a large statue of a greecian man holding his hand cupped to his ear, as if listening intently. At the statue's feet was a music stand with a book resting on it. Noticibly, there was no clear staircase or ladder leading _upstairs_.

### Potion Cellar (you cannot handle my potions)

After cautiously poking around the bookcases and finding no immediate threats, Holth decided to descend into the basement via the trap door:

> As you climb down the ladder the temperature drops significantly and the air becomes thick with a musty smell. It is dimly lit with torches on either side of the ladder and a sole torch on the opposite side of the room above a workbench.

> All around you are bookshelves lined with different vials filled with potions of every colors. The bottles are of all shapes and sizes and have a label below them. Most are written in a language you’re not familiar with, some have skulls next to them.

> You notice a wet dripping noise coming from the corner.

Holth, who had grown quite hungry from the day's ride leading up to the wizards tower was hankerin' for something to fill his belly, so he reached over to the first potion near him. He picked up a large potion jar whose red, smokey concoction swirled around revealing a pair of eyeballs which stared intensely at Holth. Unphased, Holth chugged it. A burning sensation wrecked through his entire body, but ultimately he felt stronger and slightly more handsome than before.

### Back on the 1st floor...

MJ (previously Sariel, changed names) and Flinty stepped over and began to investigate the the stone statue. Seeing the music book, they ran to fetch Mac to see if playing music into its ear would have any effect. Unfortunately, Mac fumbled over his fingers and misplayed a single note, causing a brilliant wave of radiant energy to pour forth from the music book, scorching Mac's face and brusing his pride.

The book clammored to the floor, closing itself and revealing the title to be _“Santana presents: ’Supernatural’ a steamy anthology”_. Not one to be defeated, Mac gave it another shot, playing through the sonata flawlessly. The statue slowly started to fade out of focus, becoming transparent and revealing a magical dark hole in the side of the tower. Flinty walked slowly into the hole, finding out that it was actually a teleportation portal leading to the top level of the tower. As he stepped through he noticed a group of more animalkin holding a large tree trunk, pounding at a door, attemping to break it down.

Flinty stepped back through the teleportation portal and warned MJ that they should probably grab Holth if they wanted to take them all on, so they headed back to the basement.
