With high hopes and higher stat rolls, we've successfully created five of the six characters for our campaign! We had all the required material for a first-night:

- Domino&rsquo;s Pizza (and Cans o' Wine)
- Bag o' Dice
- More players than handbooks
- Ominous LotR music


Our party consists of:
- Bard (Donovan)
- Fighter (A-a-ron)
- Paladin (Nathan)
- Ranger (Beth)
- Rogue (Aaron)
- To-Be-Decided (Ben!)
