The party graduated from Neverwinter Tower Tech University and gathered around a large notice board where new groups were being posted. To their surprise, all of the top students from each sub-school were put together into one group consisting of:

- Sariel (High-Elf Rogue)
- Mac (Dragonborne Bard)
- Holth (Half-orc Barbarian)
- Flinty Stonebeard (Dwarf Paladin)
- Thoggy (Gnome Ranger)
- And Ben (who needs to make a character still)

### First Assignment

A few moments later, a bullhorn sounded, instructing the newly formed party to meet in the headmaster's office immediately. Soon they were in the office of _Captain Albus Planet_ who gave them their first field assignment. A wizard's tower outside of town had its magical protective barrier broken, leaving it vulnerable to bandit attacks. Ben was sent ahead to check if it was a false alarm, but hasn't returned since late last night. The group is to investigate the wizard's tower, attempt to restore the magical protective barrier, and find out what happened to Ben.

### Ride to the tower

After being outfitted with a wagon by Captain Planet, the party set out just after dusk. Hours passed as they slowly road through the forest playing "I Spy" to pass the time. A few minutes before reaching the tower, they noticed a strange dark lump wearing their school's uniform in the middle of the road up ahead. Holth jumped out to investigate, turning the figure over to reveal that it was Ben! Just then, multiple marauders jumped out of the nearby trees and attacked the wagon, which were quickly and gruesomely dealt with. Flinty determined that Ben was luckily alive, but unconscious, so they moved him to the safety of the wagon and pressed onwards down the road.

### Tower's Base

A brief ride later and they reached the edge of a large clearing surrounding the wizard's tower. Sariel's keen elvish eyes noticed that something was amiss, seeing that there was more marauders guarding the entrance to the tower. The party quickly doused all of the lanterns on their wagon and attempted to sneak up on the figures guarding the entrance.

Sariel and Holth both crouched low to the ground and went opposite directions, attacking from both the left and right. As Sariel approached the first archer, a torch was lit and thrown at Sariel's feet, they'd been caught! Thinking fast, Mac the bard began jamming out on his harmonicarina (harmonica/ocarina hybrid) in an attempt to distract the guards. Sariel, hearing this music too, began pelvic-thrust dancing in a further attempt to distract the guards. The guards, not amused by the antics before them, readied their weapons as Holth jumped out from the darkness and offered up a surprise attack from the darkness. Unfortunately, Holth tripped on the steps of the wizard's stoop and fell on his face.

Mac stopped playing his harmonicarina and sprinted to the tower's base, seeing that his dear friend Holth was in danger. Rearing his head back, Mac unleashed his primal dragonborne fury, spewing poison acid all over the would-be attackers... and his dear friend Holth. Boils appeared and the smell of burnt flesh filled the air as Holth suffered near fatal amounts of burns across his back. Sariel took hold of the opportunity and quickly dispatched the remaining attackers while they were distracted by the acid that was ravaging their colleagues.

Mac felt terrible for the damage he'd inflicted onto his friend, Holth, and proceeded to imbue a melody with restorative powers, healing Holth's back and getting him back to fighting shape.

### A Peak Inside

Flinty took a peak inside of the tower's front door. The inside looked like a ransacked classroom. Bookshelves, potions, scrolls, experiments, all had been overturned and ripped apart. There was nobody inside, but there was an ominous pounding noise coming from upstairs every few seconds.

Thud.

Thud.

Thud.

Thud.
